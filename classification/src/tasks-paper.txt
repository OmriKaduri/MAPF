7. Add Feature importance and interpretability
8. Add significant wins


bank - XwTPPiFv7LJ5Aq


blender - gvxxaAa4MT4npjE

tasks from roni:
4.1 explain more about the feature extraction
Add sparsity
4.3 Sensitivity to maps (out of distribution)
4.4 Should be before feature extraction (4.1)
4.5 

feature importance (information gain)
one column - feature importance (by gain),
feature importance with one-but-all, 
table per algorithm of feature importance

table per map type 
(empty, games, cities, maze, random, room)
 of feature importance

SHOW RESULTS BY MAP TYPE (TABLE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4)



5. Sort results by accuracy 
add about combination of CNN + XGBOOST 
(both ways, manual features to
 CNN and CNN embeddings to XGBOOST)

5.1 Explain that each algorithm has it's own regression

tasks to roni:
1. More features
2. Adding new CBS
3. What new data to run? - Not for now
4. Ellaborate on evaluated algorithms + problem defintion



Sparsity
